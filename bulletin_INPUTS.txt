# LibreBulletin automated bulletin generation

# INSTRUCTIONS: 

# 1. Fill in the text fields below. Format is "FIELD_NAME: field_value", where "FIELD_NAME" must be contained verbatim
# in the "ward_bulletin_template.odt" document, and "field_value" is the verbatim word, words, or phrase you want to
# replace the corresponding "FIELD_NAME" in the .odt document via an automatic find/replace performed by this
# LibreBulletin Python script.

# 2. FIELD_NAME must be a single word with no spaces, though underscores (_) or dashes (-) are OK.

# 3. field_value can be any number of words, but if there are multiple spaces between words, they will be reduced to a
# single space. It doesn't matter how much or what kind of whitespace (tabs, spaces, etc) is between the FIELD_NAME and 
# the field_value--format this text document to your liking.

# 4. FIELD_NAME should have a colon (:) immediately following it, with *no spaces or other characters* between the
# FIELD_NAME and the colon. ie: "FIELD_NAME:". However, it will still work without the colon at the end. The colon just
# makes the list below more readable. The FIELD_NAME is simply identified as the *first word* of an uncommented line.

# 5. By convention, FIELD_NAME should be written in ALL CAPS, though this is not enforced, and it will work even if it
# is mixed case or all lower-case. Using ALL CAPS, however, helps to make the field stand out more in the .odt document
# so you can more quickly identify which words in the document are fields you expect to be replaced, and which words
# are not.

# 6. Comments in this document begin with "#", and are ignored, so feel free to delete all these comments if you feel
# like it. Blank spaces also are ignored and don't matter. 

# 7. Comments can NOT come on the same line as field names (ex: at end very end of the line), as they will be
# interpreted as field *values* instead, since all characters and words after the field *name* are automatically
# considered to be part of the field  *value*.

# 8. If you don't want to do a find/replace on a field below you can either delete it or simply comment it out by
# adding the comment character "#" in front of the FIELD_NAME. 

# 9. Order of fields doesn't matter, so feel free to re-arrange them below as you see fit.

# 10. If you'd like to add a new field to find and replace in the .odt document, simply invent one with any unique name
# you can think of (I recommend all caps and with a few preceding characters to indicate what it might mean, such as is
# indicated in the examples below [ex: "T1_", "IM_", "SM_", etc]), type it into the .odt document where you want,
# format it in the .odt document as desired, and then add the field name and value anywhere into this document below.
# Again, order doesn't matter. You can add, rename, or delete any of the fields below as you wish. Just be sure to make
# the corresponding FIELD_NAME changes in the .odt document.

# 11. If you'd like to replace a FIELD_NAME with an empty string (thereby deleting the FIELD_NAME) in the .odt document,
# just leave the field_value blank below.

# 12. Special fields are fields which will get automatically loaded into the document, but you *don't* have to fill
# them out here at all. Just make sure their FIELD_NAMEs are in the .odt document is all if you'd like to use them. See
# the list below. These fields are automatically populated with appropriate values by the LibreBulletin script.
# See the "bulletin_find_and_replace.py" file and the "config.py" file for the source code.
# Special Fields:
#   Date:
#     "D_UPCOMING_SUNDAY_DATE" = the date of this coming Sunday (or today if today is Sunday),
#     in format "August 5, 2018", for example.
#   Hymn Names: 
#     “SM_OPENING_HYMN_NAME” = opening hymn name; automatically pulled using the hymn number field below
#     “SM_SACRAMENT_HYMN_NAME” = hymn name automatically pulled based on the corresponding hymn number field below
#     “SM_INTERMEDIATE_HYMN_NAME” = hymn name automatically pulled based on the corresponding hymn number field below
#     “SM_CLOSING_HYMN_NAME” = hymn name automatically pulled based on the corresponding hymn number field below
#   For Church Cleaning Assignments Table:
#     "CCA_MONTH" = the church cleaning assignments table month--ex: "September". Nb: This field *must come first*, 
#     out of these 5 fields, for each new row in the table. Otherwise, as it is currently written, the code will not 
#     be able to properly parse and place the following 4 fields. 
#     "DAY" = the cleaning day--ex: "22"
#     "CCA_FAMILY1" = 1st family assigned to clean on this day--ex: "Smith"
#     "CCA_FAMILY2" = 2nd family assigned to clean on this day--ex: "Adams"
#     "CCA_FAMILY3" = 3rd family assigned to clean on this day--ex: "Jones"

# 13. Special markers are "fields" which must be in the document for certain script features to work, such as deleting
# the  speakers and intermediate hymn for Fast Sunday.
# Special Markers:
#     "START_OF_DELETE_FOR_FAST_SUNDAY" = a text marker placed in the document just before the 
#     list of speakers, in order to indicate to the script where to start deleting when modifying the document for
#     Fast Sundays.
#     "END_OF_DELETE_FOR_FAST_SUNDAY" = a text marker placed in the document just after the 
#     list of speakers, in order to indicate to the script where to stop deleting when modifying the document for
#     Fast Sundays.

# 14. Note: view this file in a text editor with Python syntax highlighting in order to make it easier to look at. This
# will make comments stand out from FIELDS and VALUES. Good examples of no-cost text editors for basic software
# development include Notepad++, Sublime Text, Geany, Visual Studio Code, and Atom, for example.
