I am not affiliated with Adafruit or LadyAda in any way, shape, or form. I just stuck this book in here because I think
it's AWESOME! Let me repeat: AWESOME! I also used a lot of words from the book to populate my sample
cleaning_assignments.ods document here, so I thought I'd include the book for reference. If you haven't read the names
in the document, I'd encourage you to do so. I may even get a smile out of you... :)
